Here’s the path to the Karlsson fastq files

/project/flatiron2/data/public_shotgun/karlsson2013/

There’s also a map.txt file, but note that sample 112 isn’t in the shotgun dataset (I think the files were bad).

Other shotgun data: the weird one (you can probably make sense of it; I think they used three insert sizes and they’re all sort of mixed up here) for this paper is located at:

/project/flatiron2/data/public_shotgun/qin2010/

The third one (this paper) is 82% downloaded (there are multiple runs for some samples here as well), and files are located at:
