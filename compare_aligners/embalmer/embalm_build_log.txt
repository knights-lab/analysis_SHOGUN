Using up to AVX-128 with 1 threads.

Parsed 15389 references.

Initiating database shearing procedure [shear 1000, ov 102].
Shorn refs: 13293649, rebased clumps: 830854
Avg. R Divergence: 34.093785 (264223 dupes, 13029426 uniq)
There are 13029426 references and hence 814339 clumps (+1)
Average R pack length = 1101.422529
