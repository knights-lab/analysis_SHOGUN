## Conclusions

BLAST took seconds to build and a minute or 2 to search (it's now installed on tminx)

BT2 took forever and a half to build and never searched (yet)

EMBALM took 20 minutes to build and 3hrs to search (24cores)

UTREE took couple hours to build and seconds to search

##TODO
